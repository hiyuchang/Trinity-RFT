# MIX algorithm with VLM

This is an example of using the [MIX](../../docs/sphinx_doc/source/tutorial/example_mix_algo.md) algorithm with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model. The SFT dataset can be generated by Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct model on the valiation set of the [geometry3k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hiyouga/geometry3k) dataset.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is experimental and will be subject to change in future releases.

The specific requirements are:

```yaml
vllm>=0.9.1,<0.10.0
transformers<4.53.0
qwen_vl_utils
```

The config file is located in [`mix_vlm.yaml`](mix_vlm.yaml). To get better performance, feel free to try out different algorithm hyperparameters!
