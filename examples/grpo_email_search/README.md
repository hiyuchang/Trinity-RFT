# Email Search Workflow

This example shows a multi-turn email search workflow. We implement a ReAct Agent and define tools for email search. Note that this example rewquires installing `AgentScope==0.1.6`.

For more detailed information, please refer to the [documentation](../../docs/sphinx_doc/source/tutorial/example_search_email.md).

The config files are located in [`email_search.yaml`](email_search.yaml) and [`train_email_search.yaml`](train_email_search.yaml).
